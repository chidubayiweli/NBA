# NBA Data Analysis

In this project, I explored key NBA player performance metrics and identified several standout streaks and statistics. I found that LeBron James holds the longest streak of scoring at least 20 points per game in a season, spanning an incredible 21 years from the 2003/04 to the 2023/24 season. Wilt Chamberlain holds the longest consecutive streak in rebounds, while John Stockton leads in the longest consecutive streak of at least 10 assists per game. <br>
Additionally, I analyzed playing time and discovered that the Sacramento Kingsâ€™ DeMar DeRozan played the highest average minutes per game in the 2023/24, with 37.8 minutes. He played for the Chicago Bulls last season. <br>
I also examined average points per game based on player age. The highest points-per-game average, 25.7, belongs to age 39. However, LeBron James is the only player in that age category. Furthermore, players aged 25 and over consistently outscored those younger than 25, highlighting the influence of experience on scoring performance.
